  <h2> Project Photos </h2>
  <img src= "chessset.jpg" alt= "A handmade chess set">
  <h2> Chess Set</h2>
  <p> My first real success. Prior to this handmade chess set, I had only made a lot of misshapen lumps of wood.
    It was also the longest project I ever did--it took me 3 years! And yes, we took it out for a spin immediately. I won. </p>
    <img src= "stainedswitch.jpg" alt="a relief carving of a castle on a wooden lightswitch cover">
    <h2> Lightswitch cover</h2>
    <p> Who wants a boring plastic lightswitch cover? I've always loved castles and other medieval things (you'll notice a theme in my carvings)
      and I wanted to add a little castle to my room.</p>
    <img src= "dadscane" alt+"Anna and her dad, Ed, stand in front of their home with Ed holding a cane carved with vine patterns">
    <h2> Dad's Cane</h2>
    <p> When my dad had hip surgery, I set out to make him a cane that was more stylish than titanium. This cane has vine patterns swirling up to the handle.</p>
    <img src="frame" alt="a wooden picture frame carved in a braided pattern">
    <h2> Picture Frame</h2>
    <p> This frame has a cool story. I submitted it to a silent auction to raise money for a local ministry. My friend's parents came to the auction,
      where I met them for the first time. Without knowing I had made the frame, they bid on it and won. Later, I married that friend, and his parents now
      keep our wedding photo in that frame. </p>
      <img src="knife" alt= "A wooden fantasy-style knife with a dark handle and light patterned blade">
      <h2> A Knife</h2>
      <p> It's not for stabbing--it's only wood after all. It's a pretty, decorative knife that I hang on my wall. It makes me feel cool.</p>
